### Skygraph Graph Database

This repository contains materials related to the "Skygraph: PronaÄ‘i svoj idealni odmor u Europi" seminar paper, which explores the implementation of a Google Flights-like application using the Memgraph graph database and Cypher queries.

### Project Overview

The seminar paper details the process of building a flight search application from data collection and preparation to database setup in Memgraph and the execution of meaningful Cypher queries for finding optimal flight routes.

### Contents

* **`Skygraph_seminar.pdf`**: The full seminar paper (in Croatian), providing a detailed explanation of the project, methodology, and results.

* **`skygraph.cypher`**: A file containing all the Cypher queries discussed and implemented in the seminar paper, ready for use with Memgraph.

### Getting Started

To understand the project in depth, please refer to the **`Skygraph_seminar.pdf`** paper. It covers:

* **Data Collection and Preparation**: How flight and city data was gathered and structured for a graph database.

* **Memgraph Database Setup**: Instructions and details on setting up the Memgraph instance and importing data to create nodes and relationships.

* **Cypher Queries**: A comprehensive breakdown of various queries for searching flights, finding nearest airports, and determining optimal routes based on price, duration, and layovers.

The `skygraph.cypher` file can be used to replicate the queries in your own Memgraph instance.
